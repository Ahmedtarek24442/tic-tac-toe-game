# Tic Tac Toe Game - Python Terminal
A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using Python. This game allows two players to play against each other in the terminal, with options to enter their names, choose symbols, and track scores.

### Features
  - Two Players: Supports two players with different symbols ("X" or "O").
  - Player Input Validation: Ensures that the players' names and symbols are valid.
  - Game Flow: Players take turns to select a cell and mark it with their symbol.
  - Win and Draw Detection: Checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and draws.
  - Score Tracking: Tracks the score for each player across games.
  - Menu System: Includes a main menu for starting the game, viewing players' information, and quitting the game.

This game is primarily designed as a practice project to apply and reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

### OOP Concepts Used
This project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming principles, including:
  - Classes and Objects: The game logic, board, players, and menu are each represented as classes, and their instances are used to perform the required operations.
  - Methods: Each class has methods that define its behavior, such as checking for a win, displaying the board, and handling player turns.
  - Encapsulation: Player and board information are encapsulated within their respective classes, promoting data safety and cleaner code.
